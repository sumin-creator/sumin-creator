# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 👋

Hi there! I'm sumino, a researcher at the **Autonomous Engineering Laboratory** at **Hokkaido University** 🏫.  
I'm passionate about **Machine Learning** and **Autonomous Systems**, and I work on various projects related to data analysis, algorithm development, and autonomous engineering systems 🤖.

## 🚀 My Research

At the **Autonomous Engineering Laboratory** in Hokkaido University, I focus on research in **Machine Learning** applied to autonomous systems and robotics. My work includes building models that can optimize decision-making and improve efficiency in complex environments. I’m particularly interested in exploring **reinforcement learning**, **neural networks**, and **deep learning** algorithms in various real-world applications.

Additionally, I have a growing interest in **speech recognition**. Although it is still in its early stages, I am exploring how voice data can be integrated into autonomous systems for more natural human-machine interaction.

## 💻 Programming Languages I Learned

During my time at **Hokkaido University**, I've had the opportunity to learn and work with several programming languages, each suited for different kinds of tasks:

- **C/C++**: Used for hardware-related and performance-intensive tasks in robotics and embedded systems.
- **Python**: My go-to language for machine learning and data analysis. I use libraries like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, and **TensorFlow** to work with large datasets and build predictive models.
- **MATLAB**: A great tool for mathematical modeling, especially in simulations for control systems and algorithms.
- **Java**: I’ve used Java for object-oriented programming projects and backend development.
