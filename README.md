# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 👋

Hi there! I'm sumino, a researcher at the **Autonomous Engineering Laboratory** at **Hokkaido University** 🏫.  
I'm passionate about **Machine Learning** and **Autonomous Systems**, and I work on various projects related to data analysis, algorithm development, and autonomous engineering systems 🤖.

## 🚀 My Research

At the **Autonomous Engineering Laboratory** in Hokkaido University, I focus on research in **Machine Learning** applied to autonomous systems and robotics. My work includes building models that can optimize decision-making and improve efficiency in complex environments. I’m particularly interested in exploring **reinforcement learning**, **neural networks**, and **deep learning** algorithms in various real-world applications.

Additionally, I have a growing interest in **acoustic engineering**. I am exploring how machine learning and signal processing techniques can be applied to the analysis and enhancement of sound, with potential applications in speech recognition and other audio-related fields.
